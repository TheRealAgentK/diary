# Steps

1. Create a new project.
    1. Create a single-page application.
    2. Name it 'Diary'. 
    3. Set your organisation name to your name.
    4. Set the bundle identifier to your domain name, but reversed.
    3. Set the class prefix to 'DY'. 
    4. Set the device type to 'iPhone'.
    5. Ensure that 'Use Core Data' is **off**.

We're going to make DYViewController become the DYNoteViewController.

2. Rename DYViewController to DYNoteViewController.
3. Add a text view.
4. Select the bar at the top of the view controller, and change the Title to Note

Next, we'll make the view controller that lists all of the notes.

4. Add a Navigation Controller to the storyboard.
5. Drag the Initial View Controller arrow from the Note View Controller to the Navigation Controller.
6. Drag a Table View into the Table View Controller.
7. Select the Table View. 
    1. Set its Content to Static Cells.
    2. Select the Table View Section. Set its number of rows to 1.
    3. Select the cell.
    4. Set its Style to Basic.
    
Later, we'll make it so that there's more than one cell - one for each note you add.

Now, we'll make it so that tapping the cell takes you to the Note View Controller.

8. Control-drag from the cell to the Note View Controller, and create a Push segue

One last step: set the title of the view controller.

9. Select the bar at the top of the table view controller, and change its title to Notes.
