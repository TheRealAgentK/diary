# Steps

1. **Create a new project.**
    1. Create a single-page application.
    2. Name it 'Diary'. 
    3. Set your organisation name to your name.
    4. Set the bundle identifier to your domain name, but reversed.
    3. Set the class prefix to 'DY'. 
    4. Set the device type to 'iPhone'.
    5. Ensure that 'Use Core Data' is **off**.

We're going to make DYViewController become the DYNoteViewController.

2. **Rename DYViewController to DYNoteViewController.**
